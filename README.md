#  feedmyfish

Whenever I'm not around, my fish still needs to eat. I've attached a stepper motor to my Raspberry Pi and set up a schedule for feeding my fish on Losant (see diagram below). Now I can feed remotely, or feed automatically whenever I'm not around.

If you're interested in watching the action, message me and I can send you the link to my Fish Cam, which I also host on the Pi.
